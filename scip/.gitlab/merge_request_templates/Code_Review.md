### Description

[Add a description of the introduced changes here.]

### Code review

* [ ] The code change is correct.
* [ ] The naming and place of new methods is clear and consistent **or** no new methods have been added.
* [ ] Emphasis settings are up to date.
* [ ] The code is sufficiently documented.
* [ ] The coding style is OK, see https://scipopt.org/doc/html/CODE.php.

### Documentation and building

* [ ] The CHANGELOG is up to date (including API changes if present in this MR).

* [ ] makedist.sh and both build systems are up to date (file additions/removals, ...).

### Testing

* [ ] ctest passes without errors (type some of `jenkins ctest {soplex master,soplex bugfix,cplex,gurobi,mosek,xpress}`).
* [ ] The performance impact has been checked (type some of `jenkins performance {mip,minlp,minlplib,mip quick,minlp quick,mip continue,minlp continue}`) **or** the changed code will not be executed by default.
* [ ] The new code is sufficiently covered by tests (perhaps, new coverage settings or new unit tests have been added).

### Does this merge request introduce an API change? :warning:

* [ ] No, **or** as far as possible, the code ensures backwards compatibility.

* [ ] No parameter was added/deleted/changed **or** the MR is tagged with the label 'default parameter'. (This includes the addition of parameters by adding/deleting a plugin.)
