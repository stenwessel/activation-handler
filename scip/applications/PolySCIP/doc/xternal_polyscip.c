 *
 * General information
 * ===================
 *
 * [PolySCIP] (http://polyscipopt.org) is a solver for multi-criteria integer programming and multi-criteria linear
 * programming problems.
 * In other words, it solves optimization problems of the form:
 * \f{align*}{
 * \min / \max~ (c_1^\top x&, \ldots, c_k^\top x) \\
 * \mbox{s.t. } Ax &\leq b,\\
 * x &\in \mathbb{Z}^n \lor \mathbb{Q}^n,
 * \f}
 * where \f$ k \geq 2,~ A \in \mathbb{Q}^{m \times n},~ b \in
 * \mathbb{Q}^m \f$.
 *
 * The name PolySCIP is composed of Poly (from the Greek
 * &pi;o&lambda;&upsilon;&sigmaf; meaning "many") and SCIP.
 *
 * Installation
 * ============
 *
 * See the @ref INSTALL_APPLICATIONS_EXAMPLES "Install file"
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 *
 * The problem file (in `MOP` format) is the only mandatory command line
 * argument:
 *
 *     polyscip path_to_problem_file/problem_file.mop
 *
 * runs PolySCIP on the given problem file. To switch off the SCIP solver
 * output you can execute
 *
 *     polyscip -p scipmip.set path_to_problem_file/problem_file.mop
 *
 * where `scipmip.set` is an existing SCIP parameter file (in the PolySCIP
 * folder) containing the line `display/verblevel=0`.
 *
 * To get a complete list of available PolySCIP command line arguments
 * execute
 *
 *     polyscip -h
 *
 * | parameter | long | description |
 * |-----------|------|-------------|
 * | `-h` | `--help` | Display usage information and exit |
 * | `-p` | `--params &lt;param_file.set&gt;` | Specify a file consisting of SCIP parameter settings. PolySCIP comes with the parameter settings file *scipmip.set*. A [list](http://scipopt.org/doc/html_devel/PARAMETERS.php) of all available SCIP parameters is available at \ref PARAMETERS. To switch, e.g., the verbosity level of the internal SCIP solution process to 1, write `display/verblevel=1` in the *scipmip.set* file and run *polyscip* with `-p scipmip.set` |
 * | `-W` | `--writeSolsPath &lt;path&gt;` | Path where the solution file should be written to if `-w` was set |
 * | `-e` | `--Epsilon &lt;double&gt;` | Specify epsilon used in computation of unsupported points; the default value is 1e-3 |
 * | `-d` | `--Delta &lt;double&gt;` | Specify delta used in computation of feasible boxes; the default value is 0.01 |
 * | `-r` | `–round &lt;r&gt;` | Round the weighted objective coefficient used in the function ’setWeightedObjective’ at the ’r’-th decimal position; this might be helpful in case of numberical troubles with unbounded rays |
 * | `-t` | `--timeLimit &lt;seconds&gt;` | Set a time limit in seconds on the overall SCIP computation time |
 * | `-o` | `--noOutcomes` | Switch off the output of computed outcomes |
 * | `-s` | `--noSolutions` | Switch off the output of computed solutions |
 * | `-w` | `--writeResults` | Write results to a file; default path is ./ |
 * | `-v` | `--verbose` | Switch on verbose PolySCIP output |
 * | `-x` | `--extremal` | Compute only supported non-dominated extreme point results |
 * | | `--version` | Display PolySCIP version |
 *
 * File format {#sec-format}
 * ===========
 *
 * The PolySCIP file format (with suffix `.mop`) is based on the widely
 * used `MPS` file format (see
 * [MPS format (short)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPS_%28format%29>),
 * [MPS format (detailed)](<http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/mps-format.htm>)
 * ). `MPS` is column-oriented and all model components (variables, rows, etc.) receive
 * a name. An objective in `MPS` is indicated by an `N` followed by the
 * name in the `ROWS` section. Similarly, in the `MOP` format the
 * objectives are indicated by `N` followed by the name in the `ROWS`
 * section. In general, `MPS` might not be as human readable as other
 * formats. However, one of the main reasons to base the file format of
 * PolySCIP on it is its easy extension towards several objectives and its
 * wide availability in most of the linear and integer programming software
 * packages such that available `MPS` parsers could easily be adjusted to
 * parse an `.mop` file as well. Furthermore, no user is expected to write
 * `.mop` files by hand, but to use a modelling language that does the job.
 * See \ref sec-model for a description of how to use the freely available
 * [Zimpl](http://zimpl.zib.de) and the Python script
 * `mult_zimpl_to_mop.py` (comes with PolySCIP) to generate `.mop` files.
 *
 * The following simple equation-based bi-criteria integer problem
 *
 * \f[
 * \begin{aligned}
 * &\mbox{maximize}~~~ &&\mbox{Obj1: }&& 3x_1 + 2 x_2 - 4 x_3 &&
 * \nonumber \\
 * & &&\mbox{Obj2: } &&x_1 + x_2 + 2 x_3 && \nonumber \\
 * &\mbox{subject to} && && && \nonumber \\
 * & &&\mbox{eqn: } &&x_1 + x_2 + x_3 &&= 2 \\
 * & &&\mbox{lower: } &&x_1 + 0.4 x_2 &&\leq 1.5 \nonumber \\
 * & && &&x_1,~ x_2,~ x_3 &&\geq 0 \nonumber \\
 * & && &&x_1,~ x_2,~ x_3 &&\in \mathbb{Z} \nonumber\end{aligned}
 * \f]
 *
 * is written in MOP format as follows:

 * User-friendly `.mop` file generation {#sec-model}
 * ====================================
 *
 * [Zimpl](http://zimpl.zib.de) is a freely available modelling language
 * (also part of the SCIP Optimization Suite) to translate a mathematical
 * model of a problem into a mathematical program in `.mps` (or `.lp`) file
 * format. Together with the `mult_zimpl_to_mop.py` script (located in the
 * ’mult\_zimpl’ directory of PolySCIP) it can/should be used to generate
 * your `.mop` files. For a more detailed description of Zimpl, see the
 * Zimpl [user guide](http://zimpl.zib.de/download/zimpl.pdf). In this
 * section we will only describe how to make use of it, but not all options
 * how to write different models. Zimpl does generally not support several
 * objectives; this is where `mult_zimpl_to_mop.py` comes into play. It
 * takes an ’extended’ Zimpl file containing several objectives, internally
 * rewrites all but the first objectives into constraints, calls Zimpl on
 * the rewritten file and changes the file generated by Zimpl containing
 * ’artificial’ constraint indicators back to objective indicators which
 * yields an `.mop` file.
 *
 * -   Zimpl comes with the [SCIP Optimization
 *     Suite](http://scipopt.org/#scipoptsuite)
 *
 *     -   Please see the INSTALL file of the SCIP Optimization Suite (you
 *         basically just need the GMP library in order to build).
 *
 * -   `mult_zimpl_to_mop.py` is a Python3 script and comes with PolySCIP;
 *     it is located in the ’mult\_zimpl’ directory
 *
 *     -   Execute `python3 mult_zimpl_to_mop.py your_model.zpl` to run it
 *         on the file `your_model.zpl` containing your multi-criteria
 *         model
 *
 *     -   The following command line arguments are available
 *
 * | parameter | long | description |
 * |-----------|------|-------------|
 * | `-h` | `--help` | Show the help message and exit |
 * | `-o &lt;basename&gt;` | | Basename used for the output file; the default is the basename of the input file |
 * | `-p &lt;path&gt;` | | Directory where the generated `.mop` file should be saved |
 * | | `--path\_to\_zimpl &lt;path&gt;` | Directory where your *zimpl* binary can be found |
 *
 * -   E.g., if the Zimpl executable is not installed globally but in
 *     `/home/user/bin`, and, furthermore, you would like to save the
 *     generated `.mop` file under `/tmp`, then execute
 *     `python3 mult_zimpl_to_mop.py -p /tmp/ –path_to_zimpl /home/user/bin model.zpl`
 *
 * Please note (in the following examples) that the direction of
 * optimization, i.e., `minimize` or `maximize`, is declared only once
 * followed by the first objective. All other objectives follow without a
 * direction specification implying that all objectives are assumed to be
 * either minimized or maximized.
 *
 * The bi-criteria maximization problem can be modelled
 * as follows:
 *
 *     set I := {1..3};
 *     param c1[I] := <1> 3, <2> 2, <3> -4;     #coefficients of the first objective
 *     param c2[I] := <3> 2 default 1;          #coefficients of the second objective
 *     param low[I] := <1> 1, <2> 0.4, <3> 0;   #coefficients of the lower constraint
 *     var x[I] integer >= 0;
 *
 *     maximize Obj1: sum <i> in I: c1[i]*x[i];
 *     Obj2: sum <i> in I: c2[i]*x[i];
 *
 *     subto Eqn: sum <i> in I: x[i] == 2;
 *     subto Lower: sum <i> in I: low[i]*x[i] <= 1.5;
 *
 * Saving the file, e.g., as test.zpl and running `mult_zimpl_to_mop.py` on
 * it would generate a file named `test.mop` which can be solved with
 * PolySCIP.
 *
 * Assume you want to model a tri-criteria assignment problem and your data
 * is stored in a file named `my_data.txt` in the following format:\
 *
 *     3
 *     5
 *     6, 1, 20, 2, 3,
 *     2, 6, 9, 10, 18,
 *     1, 6, 20, 5, 9,
 *     6, 8, 6, 9, 6,
 *     7, 10, 10, 6, 2
 *     ,
 *     17, 20, 8, 8, 20,
 *     10, 13, 1, 10, 15,
 *     4, 11, 1, 13, 1,
 *     19, 13, 7, 18, 17,
 *     15, 3, 5, 1, 11
 *     ,
 *     10, 7, 1, 19, 12,
 *     2, 15, 12, 10, 3,
 *     11, 20, 16, 12, 9,
 *     10, 15, 20, 11, 7,
 *     1, 9, 20, 7, 6
 *
 * The first line specifies the number of objectives, the second line
 * specifies number of variables and the following three \f$5 \times 5\f$
 * matrices contain the objective value coefficients. The tri-criteria
 * assignment problem could then be modeled as follows:
 *
 *     param prob_file := "my_data.txt";
 *     param no_objs := read prob_file as "1n" use 1;
 *     param no_vars := read prob_file as "1n" use 1 skip 1;
 *
 *     set I := {1..no_vars};
 *     set T := {1..no_objs*no_vars*no_vars};
 *     param coeffs[T] := read prob_file as "n+" match "[0-9]+" skip 2;
 *     param offset := no_vars*no_vars;
 *     param Obj1[<i,j> in I*I] := coeffs[(i-1)*no_vars + j];
 *     param Obj2[<i,j> in I*I] := coeffs[(i-1)*no_vars + j + offset];
 *     param Obj3[<i,j> in I*I] := coeffs[(i-1)*no_vars + j + 2*offset];
 *
 *     var x[I*I] binary;
 *
 *     minimize Obj1: sum <i,j> in I*I: Obj1[i,j]*x[i,j];
 *     Obj2: sum <i,j> in I*I: Obj2[i,j]*x[i,j];
 *     Obj3: sum <i,j> in I*I: Obj3[i,j]*x[i,j];
 *
 *     subto row: forall <i> in I do
 *           sum <j> in I: x[i,j] == 1;
 *     subto col: forall <i> in I do
 *           sum <j> in I: x[j,i] == 1;
 *
 * Again, saving the file, e.g., as testCube.zpl and running
 * `mult_zimpl_to_mop.py` on it would generate a file named `testCube.mop`
 * which can be solved with PolySCIP.
 *

 * guide](http://zimpl.zib.de/download/zimpl.pdf) for more modelling
